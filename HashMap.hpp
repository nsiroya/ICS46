// ICS 45C Spring 2020
// Project #3: Maps and Legends
//
// This header file contains a declaration for a "well-behaved" HashMap
// class, which is a separately-chained hash table implementation of a
// map/dictionary data structure (i.e., a collection of key/value pairs),
// where the keys and values are strings.
//
// This HashMap consists of a dynamically-allocated array of "buckets,"
// each of which is a pointer to the first node in a linked list of
// key/value pairs that have hashed to that bucket.
//
// You may not make changes to the public members of this class the way
// they're declared now, since we will be running unit tests against
// your class that will expect these declarations not to have changed
// (and that its member functions are implemented as specified in the
// comments below).  However, you are free to add whatever additional
// members you feel are necessary, including new member variables or
// member functions (public or private).

public:
    // This is called a "type alias," which is a way to define a new
    // type that is a synonym for an existing one.  In this case,
    // we're introducing HashFunction as a new name for a type
    // representing a function that takes a reference to a constant
    // string and returns an unsigned int.  Given that, a variable
    // or parameter of type HashFunction can be assigned such a
    // function.
    //
    // Hash functions must conform to these properties:
    //
    // (1) Given a particular string repeatedly, they must always
    //     return the same hash value.
    // (2) They cannot take the number of buckets into account (as they
    //     do not receive a parameter that tells them how many buckets
    //     there are).  As a result of this, the result can be any
    //     unsigned int value (i.e., the result won't necessarily be a
    //     legitimate index for a bucket.  It will be the job of the
    //     HashMap class to reduce the results to the range of
    //     available bucket indices (e.g., by using the % operator).

    // to a variable that's constant, except that it can be defined as
    // any arbitrary expression that can be calculated at compile time.)
    //
